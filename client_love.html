                How many times have I rung/texted/emailed - sometimes all three at once - with a nightmare tech problem? BUT VJ never fails. Back he comes with calm advice, works out what to do and makes it happen - even from a distance
                and that is a real stress buster. Drama Queen? Maybe, but when you want it fixed, you want it fixed.

                He is totally trustworthy, as a result, I have had no reservations about him accessing my computer remotely.
                VJ is readily available and quick to respond which is crucial when running your own business that relies on the technology working.
                I have peace of mind knowing that there is someone I can trust who will help and advise when things go wrong no matter where he is."</i></p>
